# CycleGAN
This repository contains a CycleGAN implementation in PyTorch for image-to-image translation tasks. It has been trained to perform transformations between apples and oranges, enabling the conversion of apples to oranges and vice versa. The model demonstrates the capability of CycleGAN for object-to-object translation.
